# Postman Learning Repository

This repository contains Postman collections and environments for learning and collaboration purposes. I'm currently learning Postman and sharing my API testing configurations here.

## What's included:

- Environment configurations
- API testing examples

## How to use:
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Import the .json files into your Postman workspace
